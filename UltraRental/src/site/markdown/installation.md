## Installation ##
Installation of UltraTrader requires only a few things to be done.

+ Download *Citizens 2*
+ Make sure *Citizens 2* is installed correctly
+ Download *Vault* (Make sure you have a Economy Plugin installed)
+ Make sure *Vault* is installed correctly
+ Download *UltraTrader*
+ Drop into plugins folder
+ Start and then Stop server (eventually all basic settings will be done ingame)
+ Edit `config.yml` and `limits.yml`
+ Restart server.

### Permissions ###
I don't set any permissions by default, I leave this to the admin.

Almost everything in UltraTrader will come with a permission, so be careful what you
set.

The basic permission you will likely want to set on a new server is:

**trader.store.use** to all users, so they can use the shops you create.
