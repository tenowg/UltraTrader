CitiTradersRE (REvisited)
=========================

First off, some notes to previous users...

This plugin no longer is going to depend on Citizens API, why not? Not that I don't love citizens and have a great
respect for the authors, there are some limitations that I need to get around to make this a complete shop plugin
the likes that bukkit has never seen.

Goals
=====
ANY Item, Mob, NPC (even ones created with Citizens) can be a store. There will be no limits.
I am even looking into creating PORTALABLE stores (as in, stores attached to items in hand, right click to access)

1) Stores will be accessable by voice (chat) by name.
2) Stores will be clickable.
3) Stores will be configuable to cascade (Catagories -> Catagories -> Items)
4) ADMIN, USER, SERVER shops will be possible.
5) Items will have custom ToolTips to represent cost

Welcome to CITITRADERS Revisited, this will be the best most flexable store plugin ever created ;) Welcome home.
