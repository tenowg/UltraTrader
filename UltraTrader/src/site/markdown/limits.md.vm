$h2 Limits
Limits are set with defaults in the `config.yml` and then overridden with permissions.

$h2 Permissions
You can assign limit permissions to any player/group via a permissions plugin and it will
override any permission in the limits.yml. This will allow you to create custom
permissions for users without the need to create new permissions in limits.yml for
each different settings.

The permission limits all start with `trader.limits` and the next word is the limit
`maxshops` so `trader.limits.maxshops` would be the first part of the permission.
Then you just append the number (shops in this case) that is the limit.

`trader.limits.maxshops.2`

would limit the players max number of shops to 2.

All the Permission nodes required setting permission limits can be found here:
[Limits] (permission.html#Limits)

$h3 Required Traits
It is possible to require that some traits be present on NPCs when a player
creates them, if they are not present then they will be added automatically.

To let Ultratrader know that some traits are required to you will use permissions.

`trader.limits.required.groupname.traitname`

Groupname is the group the special group the player is in (usually this would
likely be `default`, or `trader.limits.required.default.traitname` but if you use
more than one system of protections then you would want to give out different
groups of requirements.

$h4 Why would I set required Traits
Required traits are a way of controlling an NPCs location, or actions. With the addition
of External Plugins to extend Ultratrader there is now the possibility of many
additional traits that can be assigned to an NPC. Many of the traits will work as
flags.

`worldguardowner` or `worldguardmember`

If you use the UltraWorldGuard plugin with Ultratrader, then you will use those two
traits. If you set either to required traits, then if the NPC being created/used will
not be created/used if the NPC is not within a regions the owner of the NPC is a member
or owner of.

$h3 Defaults
A special note about the defaults section. The options can change, but the keys
and sections need to stay the same. Most of these settings are what a player
gets if they just have the permissions needed to make a shop. So make sure that
the settings in this section are good for everyone, unless you place players
that can have shops into a special group/permission.
