$h2 Limits
There are 2 ways to set limits in Ultratrader. You can use the limits.yml method, which
will allow you to set permission groups to assign to players/groups via a permission
system. Or you can use individual permissions.

$h2 Permissions
You can assign limit permissions to any player/group via a permissions plugin and it will
override any permission in the limits.yml. This will allow you to create custom
permissions for users without the need to create new permissions in limits.yml for
each different settings.

The permission limits all start with `trader.limits` and the next word is the limit
`maxshops` so `trader.limits.maxshops` would be the first part of the permission.
Then you just append the number (shops in this case) that is the limit.

`trader.limits.maxshops.2`

would limit the players max number of shops to 2. Remember this will override the
limits.yml setting for whatever group this player is in, but not the other settings
assigned by limits.yml.

All the Permission nodes required setting permission limits can be found here:
[Limits] (permission.html#Limits)

$h3 Defaults
A special note about the defaults section. The options can change, but the keys
and sections need to stay the same. Most of these settings are what a player
gets if they just have the permissions needed to make a shop. So make sure that
the settings in this section are good for everyone, unless you place players
that can have shops into a special group/permission.

In the Section below each item is explained.
