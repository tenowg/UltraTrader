#h2 Create A Trader
$h3 NPC
Creating an NPC trader is very simple, follow the following instructions and you should be up and running in no time.

$h4 Create the NPC
You will need to use a Citizens 2 command to create an NPC.

    /npc create npcName

Where npcName is the name of the NPC you wish to create.

$h4 Assign the UltraTrader trait
Again you are going to be using a Citizens 2 command to assign the CitiTrader trait.

    /trait ultratrader

This will assign the basic UltraTrader trait to your npc. He is not yet a shop yet.

$h4 Activate the Shop
Next you are going to either `assign` or `create` a shop. This shop can be any shop you own, or have access too, or be brand new.
All you need to do is `right click` the NPC and start a conversation with him.

Once the conversation is started all you need to do is follow the instructions and everything will be taken care of for you.

When done, just click the trader again, and your shop will open for you.
