## CitiTradersRE

###What is CitiTraders
CitiTraders was a popular bukkit plugin that works with Citizens to create very flexible traders/shops with NPCs. CitiTradersRE is
a re-write of this plugin from the ground up. Originally written by tehBeard, and maintained by tenowg, I have decided to re-write
it from the ground up with 100% new code.

###Dependencies
* Vault (required to handle all Economy functions)
    * Will eventually handle external banks.
    * Player banks
* (Optional) Citizens 2, although shops will function the same they will only be able to be attached to blocks and item, to use NPCs
you will need Citizens 2.
